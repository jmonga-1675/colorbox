<h4><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Juan Pablo enjoyed a life full of the comforts of a regular, american middle class lifestyle. It seemed as though nothing could go wrong; that everything would continue as it had been since he and Maria-Evelin got married ten years ago. With their two children they moved to a bigger house in a bigger area; they got nicer neighbors and a Juan Pablo got a nicer job. The day Juan Pablo lost his job at the stapler factory was indeed one of the hardest in his life. Not only did he have to tell his wife that he couldn&rsquo;t provide for her anymore, but that he lost a way to provide for their children as well. He decided the best course of action was to not tell them, and find another source of income. But you see, Juan Pablo wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most virtuous man. He late nights and shady dealings were how he gave his family the life they had become accustomed to. That tragic event was something that the father, provider, and lover in Juan Pablo wouldn&rsquo;t let go unanswered. With his desire for revenge and his ambition, Juan Pablo can get anything done. His many traits all manifest into his different desires and internal emotions.</strong></span></h4>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">Blue:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">When Juan Pablo is blue he is trying to reconcile with the death of his three beloved. He is constant in a state of denial, and he is continuing to believe if he takes care of those responsible that he will be at peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">Green:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">The green represents Juan Pablo&rsquo;s desire to be a duck. When he was a child he saw that ducks just had the greatest lives. Now, in this time of intense turmoil, he yearns to have that life of simplicity.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">Red:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Juan Pablo&rsquo;s red state is intended to display his intense hatred for those who have wronged him. In this state his is blinded by the desire for vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iEWrwl4.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">White:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">When Juan Pablo is white it shows his total lack of emotional empathy after all the trauma that is haunting him. He is completely dissociated and disconnected from his ability to feel and to show emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3JGDH9S.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Yellow:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">During the time of Juan Pablo&rsquo;s yellow state, he is projecting his inner cowardice and innocence. Juan Pablo was not a malicious man, he was a desperate one. This shows that even throughout all his evil acts and throughout his extreme will for revenge, he is just a man with a will for a better life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jTDXJEF.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Cyan:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">The cyan mode signifies Juan Pablo&rsquo;s remembrance for his children. Since they were his own flesh and blood he loved them more than anything in the world - maybe even his wife. They were young, and what happened to them was just plain barbaric, so he always thinks about what they could have been; what they could have done.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">Magenta:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Juan Pablo&rsquo;s magenta states represents his eternal hope. He knows that no matter what has happened, and that no matter what will happen, that everything will be ok. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel.</span></p>
